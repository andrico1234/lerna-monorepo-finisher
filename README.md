# Lerna Monorepo Article (Starter)
The accompanying starter project for the Lerna Monorepo article here TODO: add link

The blog post is a tutorial that will get you familiar with the whys and hows of using a monorepo.

You'll be learning how to use Lerna to create separate packages in the same repo. You'll also make a 
separate package for shared components and utilities.

CI/CD and deployments will also be covered, allowing you to share a pipeline script that tests, builds and deploys
each of your monorepo packages. Travis CI will be to handle our CI pipeline. Heroku will be used to handle deployments 

The application has been scaffolded using Gatsby
## Install

Install the packages using Yarn
```bash
yarn
```

To run your starter project run the following
```bash
gatsby develop
```

You'll then be able to access it on `localhost:8000`
